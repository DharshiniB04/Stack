# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 

The main operations on a stack are:

**Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.

**Pop:** Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.

**Peek/Top:** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

**isEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
